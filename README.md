## Inspiration

MetaQuest draws its inspiration from the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic when students missed their campus life and the cherished connections they had with friends. We recognized the deep longing for the campus environment and the vibrant social interactions that students yearned for. It was this shared longing that fueled our vision.

Our inspiration stemmed from the desire to recreate the campus experience in a digital realm, allowing students to relive those memorable moments. MetaQuest was conceived as a place where students could:

- Reconnect with the architecture and atmosphere of their campus, evoking a sense of nostalgia.
- Play games and engage in challenges with friends and fellow students, just like they would on campus.
- Initiate video chats, recreating the spontaneous and meaningful interactions they once had in person.

For incoming freshmen, MetaQuest offers a unique opportunity to get a taste of campus life before stepping foot on campus. It's not just about recreating a physical space; it's about rekindling the spirit of campus life and forging lasting connections.

## What it does

MetaQuest serves as a digital bridge between students and their campus experience. It allows them to:

- Immerse themselves in a faithful digital recreation of their campus, reliving its beauty and architecture.
- Engage in a wide array of games and challenges with their friends and fellow students, just like they would on campus.
- Initiate video chats, recreating the spontaneous and meaningful interactions they once had in person.

In essence, MetaQuest encapsulates the essence of campus life, providing a space where students can bond, have fun, and create memories, regardless of physical distance.

Despite these challenges, our dedicated team persevered, leading to the creation of a robust and immersive platform that captures the essence of campus life.
